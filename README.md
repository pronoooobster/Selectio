# Selectio

3D online ecosystem simulation

Website: https://pro-noobster.itch.io/selectio

Technologies used: C#, HTML5, Unity3D, Git;

- Creatures' mutation, natural selection, and evolution algorithms implemented with C#;
- 3D visualization of the ecosystem;
- An intuitive user interface and simulation settings menu have been developed;
- The application has the ability to build graphs of time dependences based on data on the population of creatures, their evolution and need for food;
- The simulation is available both online with a WebGL build and on the desktop;
- The application also allows to simulate food chains.

The application allows to establish the ratio of population change to environmental pollution; the ratio of population change of one species to population change of another.
Determining the impact of environmental pollution on the lives of animal populations is of scientific and practical interest.
